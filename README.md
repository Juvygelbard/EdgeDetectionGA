# Edge Detection GA
An implamentation of M. G. Mundsson, E. A. El-Kwae, and M. R. Kabuka algorithm.
This implamentation uses python's Multiprocessing module in order to do parallel work on a few areas of the imgae. Therefore, it cannot run using an IDE. Use the run.bat batch to run it on a Windows OS.
You are welcome to tweak different parameteres (e.g. number of generation, population size, factors weight etc.), and see it's afects on the final result.
Python 3.5 and Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib libs are required.
